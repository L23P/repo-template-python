# README format guidance

A clear README helps users understand and adopt your project quickly. This template recommends the following structure:

1. Project title
2. Badges (CI, coverage, license)
3. One-paragraph overview
4. Table of contents (optional for long READMEs)
5. Features / Whatâ€™s included
6. Quick start (installation and minimal example)
7. Usage (API or CLI examples)
8. Development workflow (lint, test, type-check)
9. Project structure
10. Configuration (env vars, settings)
11. Versioning and changelog
12. Contributing and code of conduct
13. License

Tips:
- Keep commands copyable and shell-specific when possible (PowerShell for Windows users).
- Prefer concise examples over exhaustive docs; link to docs/ for depth.
- Avoid emojis in professional contexts if your style guide prefers it.
